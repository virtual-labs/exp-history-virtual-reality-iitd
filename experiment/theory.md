<strong>1. Introduction to the history of Virtual Reality as mode of communication.</strong>

The history of virtual reality (VR) is a fascinating journey through the realms of technology, innovation, and human imagination. It spans several decades, marked by key milestones and breakthroughs that have shaped the evolution of VR as we know it today. In 1965, computer scientist Ivan Sutherland introduced the concept of virtual reality with his groundbreaking work on the "Ultimate Display" at Harvard University. His paper, "The Ultimate Display," published in 1965, laid the theoretical groundwork for immersive virtual environments and interactive computer graphics. [1]. Sutherland's vision became a reality in 1968 when he developed the first head-mounted display (HMD), known as the "Sword of Damocles." This device allowed users to experience basic virtual environments, laying the foundation for future VR technologies. [2]. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, VR gained momentum with the introduction of commercial VR systems by companies like SEGA and Nintendo. SEGA released the SEGA VR headset in the early 1990s, while Nintendo launched the Virtual Boy in 1995, albeit with limited success. [3][4]. However, the early promise of VR was met with challenges, leading to a period known as the "Virtual Winter." Technological limitations, high costs, and a lack of compelling content contributed to a decline in public interest in VR during the late 1990s and early 2000s. [5]. The turn of the millennium saw a resurgence of interest in VR, fueled by advancements in computing power, graphics technology, and user interfaces. Hollywood blockbusters like "The Matrix" (1999) brought the concept of virtual worlds to mainstream audiences, inspiring a new generation of VR enthusiasts. [6]

In 2012, Palmer Luckey founded Oculus VR, a startup focused on developing affordable and high-quality VR hardware. Oculus Rift, the company's flagship VR headset, garnered widespread attention and acclaim, leading to Facebook's acquisition of Oculus VR in 2014. [7]. Since then, VR has continued to evolve, with major tech companies like HTC, Sony, and Microsoft investing in VR platforms and experiences. From immersive gaming and entertainment to applications in healthcare, education, and beyond, VR has become an integral part of our digital landscape, offering new possibilities for exploration, creativity, and collaboration.
